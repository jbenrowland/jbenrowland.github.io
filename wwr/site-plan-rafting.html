    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this website is to provide a platform where I can share my personal interest in whitewater rafting, as well as build revenue as a emerging business in the industry. This website is essential to my business and to my success because it will allow my business to connect with customers over the internet for them to be able to view and purchase my products and services, as well as provide them with the convenience of ordering my products and services anywhere at anytime. With the addition of this website, my business will be able to flourish far into the future.</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>My target audience is not any particular age group, but realistically it will most likely be anyone between the ages of 10-65. The reason for this is because while whitewater rafting is fun, it is a lot of physical excercise and can also be potentially harmful to small children, as well as most people over the age of 65. WHile these age groups are not ruled out, they just are much less likely to my purchasing my products and services, so they are not a particular focus for me. In addition, the location of my customers is also a big focus for me. Since I am located on the Fork River in Glenwood Springs, Colorado, I want to prioritize the needs of the customers that are located within a 100-mile radius of my company's location. On my website, I want people to know exactly where I am located on a map and how easily navigate there. I would also like for my customers to be able to make purchases on my website quickly and easily, so that they can have the best experiences with my brand and services. I plan on keeping my website very accessible to anyone who might be interested in not only rafting, but also outdoors activities in general. I think these additions to my website will accomplish my goal of inviting the kind of people I want to my website. Once the website is complete, my target audience will be able to access my website not only on their desktop or laptop, but also their mobile devices as well, so that everyone can have accessibility to my website and my business.</p>
